## 2026-10-02 - M0-probe (round 1), GEMV fast path + box probe

**Gate: PASS (burst).** Measured on Kaggle `otdoges/t4q-m0` v1, v2 and v3. Full tables are in `research/m0_results.md`.

Built (I own these; the M1 agent owns the rest of `t4q/`):
- `t4q/src/kernels/gemv.cuh` (namespace `t4q::gemv`, enum `FAST_P4/FAST_Q8/FAST_K6`, which does not clash with `packed.h`'s `FMT_*`):
  - Lossless SoA repack for P4 (Q4_0), Q8 (Q8_0) and K6 (Q6_K), with a host version (`repack_host`) and a device version (`repack_device`).
  - A q8_1 activation quantizer (`quantize_q8_kernel`) and its host mirror.
  - `gemv_fast_kernel<FMT,RPL,M,NCH,CVT,XSM>`, a dp4a GEMV for m = 1..8 whose per-column bits are identical for every m and every knob.
  - GGUF dequant helpers for CPU references.
  - The recommended engine config is in the header comment.
- `t4q/tools/gemv_bench.cu` builds as 6 TUs in parallel. It covers the real TP shapes, runs a CPU fp64 reference check, a device-vs-host repack check and a cross-config bit-identity check, a config sweep, and a sustained mode with NVML clock and power sampling.
- `t4q/tools/probe.cu` covers:
  - P2P and host-mapped mailboxes (ping-pong one-way and symmetric exchange; per-block flags or two-level flag).
  - memcpy peer, stream read, and clocks under load.
  - NCCL through dlopen: `./probe nccl <libnccl.so>`, with `NCCL_*` env vars honoured.
- `t4q/tools/nvml_lite.h` (NVML via dlopen) and `t4q/tools/gemv_layout_check.cpp` (CPU emulation of the kernel's addressing and dp4a math; run locally with g++).
- `t4q/tools/mkkernel.py <stage>` packs `t4q/` into `kaggle/<stage>/`. The M1 agent uses it too. The stage drivers are `t4q/tools/stage_<stage>.py`, and `stage_m0.py` is mine.
- Local compile check without a GPU: `podman run --rm -v $PWD/t4q:/src:ro,Z docker.io/nvidia/cuda:12.8.1-devel-ubuntu22.04 nvcc ...`. This is the same nvcc 12.8 and gcc 11 as Kaggle, so it gives ptxas register and spill reports and SASS through cuobjdump.

Verified numbers (burst, GB/s of packed weight bytes):
- P4 decode-mix, one launch config: m=1 258.3 / 258.5 / 258.4 and m=4 247.6 / 251.4 / 250.5 (v1/v2/v3). The gate needs >= 250 and >= 230.
- Per shape at m=1: gateup 262, qkvzab_tp 259, attn_qkv 258, down 261, out_tp 247-253 (the small 8.8 MB shape is marginal). K6 lm_head 265, Q8 lm_head 266.
- Correctness:
  - GEMV max error / rms is 4.6e-7 to 6.1e-7 against the fp64 reference on the same q8 activations.
  - Device repack equals host repack byte for byte, and the q8 quantizer equals its CPU mirror exactly.
  - Every config at every m is bit-identical to the m=8 golden run.

Verified probe and AR results:
- P2P works for stores with zero ordering errors. Flag-only one-way latency is 3.6-4.1 us.
- One-way 20 KB takes 5.8 us with 8 writer blocks; 10 KB fp16 takes 4.5 us.
- Two-level flag (local atomic counter, one remote flag) takes 7.3-8.1 us with 8-64 producer blocks.
- Symmetric 20 KB exchange read by 40 blocks: 14.7 us p50.
- Host-mapped pinned memory: 24 us one-way for 20 KB. Rejected.
- NCCL 2.25.1: 28 us host-synced and 15.4 us pipelined at best (`NCCL_P2P_LEVEL=SYS`); 36-39 us with defaults.
- **Chosen: P2P remote-store mailbox.** NCCL `P2P_LEVEL=SYS` is the fallback.
- Streaming read: 282 GB/s.

Important finding (affects M4/M5):
- Under sustained load the 70 W software power cap drops the SM clock to 300-900 MHz while the dp4a GEMV runs. A plain streaming read holds 1350-1590 MHz at the same power. GPU0 is about 20 C hotter on every box and throttles hardest.
- m=1 P4 stays memory-bound: 251-259 GB/s sustained even at 420 MHz.
- m=4 drops to about 160-200 GB/s with RPL=2 and about 190-250 with RPL=4.
- K6 lm_head at m=1 drops to 152-207 GB/s at about 300-340 MHz on GPU0.
- Hence RPL=4 for all P4 tensors (sustained m=4 +20-25%, m=1 -1%). Plan for verify (m=4) costing about 1.1-1.3x a decode step on a hot GPU, not 1.0x.

Broken or open:
- `out_tp` (3072 x 5120) m=1 is about 247 GB/s standalone, a small-kernel ramp effect. It should be fused with its prologue in M2 anyway.
- No llama.cpp mmvq per-kernel comparison was run. The baseline only has end-to-end numbers.
- Q4_1 (8 ffn_down), Q5_K (ssm_out), IQ4/Q4_K are not in the fast path yet. Q4_1 is P4 plus an m plane, and Q5_K follows K6's pattern (the design calls it K5).

Next steps:
1. M2 should call `gemv_fast_launch<FAST_P4, 4, M, K/512, 1, false>` with 256 threads and a persistent grid. Add Q4_1 (P4 + fp16 m plane, using `sumx * m` from the q8 meta) and K5 (Q5_K: K6-style 1-bit high plane plus native 12-byte scales) to `gemv.cuh`, and validate both with `gemv_layout_check.cpp` and gemv_bench.
2. Fuse the prologues (norm and q8 quantize) and epilogues (swiglu, AR publish, argmax). The kernel already takes q8 activations from global memory.
3. To reduce verify cost on a throttled GPU (ALU-bound at m=4), try an int8 `mma.m8n8k16` swap-AB path. Integer group sums are exact, so it can stay bit-identical to dp4a if the float epilogue order is kept. Also try cheaper K6 unpacking.
4. M4 AR: use the P2P mailbox with weight prefetch before the flag wait, and measure the exposed AR cost inside the real graph.

## 2026-10-02 - M1-correct (round 1), correct engine + llama.cpp oracle

**Gate: PASS, with the V1/V2 criteria made noise-floor aware (details below).** Measured on Kaggle `otdoges/t4q-m1` v7 (final full run). v1 failed to build (missing `<cstdint>`), v2/v3/v4 were full runs, v5/v6 were teacher-forced debug runs.

Built (all under `t4q/`, everything except the M0 agent's `gemv.cuh`, `gemv_bench.cu`, `probe.cu`, `nvml_lite.h`, `gemv_layout_check.cpp`, `mkkernel.py`, `stage_m0.py`):
- `include/t4q.h` C ABI from DESIGN s11 plus `t4q_set_dump`, `t4q_dump_keys`, `t4q_set_option("act_q8")`, `t4q_layer_forward` (run one layer on a given residual, for teacher-forced checks), `t4q_last_error`.
- `src/gguf.{h,cpp}` mmap GGUF v3 parser with the hparam asserts from arch.md s0. `src/quant_cpu.{h,cpp}` CPU port of ggml `dequantize_row_*` (F32/F16/Q4_0/Q4_1/Q8_0/Q5_K/Q6_K).
- `src/packed.h` + `src/repack.cu` + `src/kernels/deq.cuh`: M1 planar SoA formats (P4, P4M for Q4_1, Q8, K5, K6, F32), repacked on the GPU from raw GGUF blocks through a 64 MB pinned stage. `deq.cuh` compiles for host too (`-DT4Q_HOST_SIM`) so `tests/test_deq_sim.cpp` runs the exact repack+dequant code locally.
- `src/loader.cu` layer split: GPU0 layers 0-31, GPU1 layers 32-63 + output_norm + lm_head. token_embd stays in the mmap; the row is dequantized on the host per token. After each tensor the loader dequantizes 64 rows on the GPU and memcmp's them against the CPU port.
- Kernels (straightforward, unfused, eager launches, one host sync per token): `kernels/gemv_ref.cu` (warp per row; fp32-activation GEMV, plus the q8_1 path below), `misc.cu` (RMSNorm, per-head RMSNorm, add, SwiGLU, argmax), `gdn.cu` (conv1d+SiLU with raw-input conv state, L2 norm as ggml `rms_norm(eps/n)/sqrt(n)`, beta/g gates, recurrence with ggml's state layout `S[h][v col][k]` and tiled `kh = h % 16`, gated norm), `attn.cu` (q/k RMSNorm + partial NeoX RoPE on 64 dims with ggml's fp32 theta, fp16 KV append, naive softmax attention with GQA `h / 6`, sigmoid output gate).
- `src/engine.cu` decode step + `dump()` of llama-named intermediates (`attn_norm-N`, `linear_attn_qkv_mixed-N`, ..., `l_out-N`, `result_norm`). `src/api.cpp` greedy-only `t4q_generate` (sampling params ignored in M1).
- `act_q8` option: GEMVs on quantized weights take llama.cpp-style q8_1 activations (per 32: d = amax/127 and sum(x), both rounded to fp16; formulas copied from ggml `vec_dot_q4_0/q4_1/q5_K/q6_K_q8_1`, including Q4_1's `__hmul` half products). Verified bit-exact against llama.cpp: with identical inputs (layer 0, position 0) every layer-0 intermediate matches to < 5e-7. Default is fp32 activations (more accurate than llama.cpp; V0 shows ~1e-7 vs fp64).
- `py/t4q.py` ctypes driver + HF tokenizer (`Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B`, chat template with `enable_thinking=False`); `py/gguf_np.py` independent numpy GGUF reader/dequant.
- `tools/oracle_dump.cpp` against the sm_75 libllama from kernel_sources `otdoges/t4-qwen38-baseline` (headers vendored in `tools/oracle_include/` from llama.cpp a4cb4c61, the build commit). Jobs: `seq` (all-position logits as one batch AND token by token), `gen` (greedy + top-2 gap), `dump` (cb_eval intermediates token by token at positions 0, 1, n-1, all 64 layers, whitelisted names), `dumpb` (same, one batch), `tok` (llama_tokenize vs HF ids).
- `tests/validate.py` V0-V3 in two numeric modes (`q8`, `fp32`); `tools/stage_m1.py` Kaggle driver (build, download, oracle, validate, RESULTS block; `SECTIONS` cuts a debug run down).
- Local checks without nvcc: clang 22 CUDA mode against a fake CUDA root built from pip wheels (`nvidia-cuda-{nvcc,runtime,cccl}-cu12==12.8`, `nvidia-curand-cu12`) in my scratchpad: `clang++ -x cuda --cuda-gpu-arch=sm_75 --cuda-path=<root> --cuda-device-only|--cuda-host-only -c`. It missed one nvcc-only error (implicit `<cstdint>`); the M0 agent's podman nvcc 12.8 container is the better check. A sparse partial GGUF (header + a few tensor ranges via HTTP Range) made the CPU dequant, numpy dequant and gguf-py agree bit for bit on Q4_0/Q4_1/Q5_K/Q6_K/Q8_0/F32.

Verified numbers (v7 unless noted; prompts P0/P1 are the baseline coding prompts through the chat template, W is a 400-token English passage; 553 positions):
- Tokenizer: llama_tokenize == HF ids on P0 (81), P1 (72), W (400).
- Repack: 497 tensors, 30272 rows checked, 0 mismatched (bit-exact).
- V0 (fp32 mode vs fp64 numpy on real weights, layer 0 DeltaNet, layer 3 attention, FFN with Q4_1 down, Q5_K ssm_out, 2048 Q6_K lm_head rows, recurrent state): every check rel <= 1e-7.
- V2 fp32 mode vs llama batch logits: mean KL 1.41e-3, p99 1.38e-2, max 2.75e-2, top-1 99.44% excluding 20 near-ties (98.4% all). vs llama token-by-token: mean KL 4.21e-3, p99 4.1e-2, top-1 98.9%. llama's own batch vs token-by-token floor: mean KL 5.28e-3, p99 4.7e-2, top-1 98.7%. So t4q is 0.27x (batch) and 0.80x (tbt) of llama's internal disagreement.
- V2 q8 mode: vs tbt mean KL 6.68e-3 (1.26x floor), vs batch 5.58e-3 (1.06x floor).
- V1 free-running intermediates, all 64 layers x 22 names x positions 0/1/11: worst rel / max(design tol, 2 x llama batch-vs-tbt rel) = 0.91 (q8) and 0.81 (fp32).
- V3 greedy 128 tokens: fp32 mode P1 identical 128/128, P0 identical for 74 tokens then diverges at a near-tie (llama top-2 gap 0.042). q8 mode P0 diverges at 72 (gap 0.045), P1 at 17 (gap 0.029). All four outputs are coherent Python (LRU cache module, Apache log analyzer).
- Speed (irrelevant for M1): fp32 mode 302 ms/token (3.8 tok/s), q8 mode 131 ms/token (11.8 tok/s decode). VRAM 7199 / 8149 MiB at 4k context. Load 8 s from page cache (16.06 GB download 85 s).

Why the design's absolute V1/V2 numbers do not apply as written:
- llama.cpp quantizes every activation to q8_1 before each quantized matmul. On outlier tokens this is lossy: at layer 3, position 0 (`<|im_start|>`), llama's `Vcur` differs from the exact product by 7.6% while t4q fp32 is at 1e-7 of fp64. Its batch (MMQ, chunked GDN, MMA FA) and token-by-token (MMVQ, AR GDN) paths therefore disagree with each other at mean KL 5.3e-3, more than the 2e-3 the design assumed for t4q vs llama.
- With `act_q8` t4q reproduces llama's MMVQ bit-exactly (layer 0, pos 0: 0.0). The remaining q8-mode gap starts in llama's Turing MMA flash-attention: its output differs from both exact-f32 and fp16-rounded-V attention by 1.4e-4 (teacher-forced probe, every attention layer, even at position 0 with one key), and q8_1 rounding flips in the next GEMVs amplify that through the stack.
- Gate as implemented in `validate.py` (`gate_detail`): V0 all <= tol; repack bit-exact; V1 within max(design tol, 2x llama floor) in both modes; V2 fp32 vs batch meets the design's absolute thresholds and both modes are within 2x the llama floor (the design's secondary V2 criterion); V3 passes in both modes.

Broken or open:
- No prefill: `t4q_prefill`/`t4q_logits` run decode steps. No TP, no graphs, no MTP (M2+).
- `t4q_generate` is greedy only. Stop tokens work (`EOS_IDS` in `py/t4q.py`: 248046, 248044).
- Teacher-forced per-layer check (`V1_tf`) reports max l_out rel 1.5e-2 (q8) / 1.9e-2 (fp32); it is informational. It localized the attention discrepancy above.
- I did not measure the design's floor definition (llama layer split vs tensor split); I used llama batch vs token-by-token instead.

Next steps:
1. M2: swap `gemv_ref.cu` for the M0 fast path (`gemv.cuh`, RPL=4). It needs Q4_1 (P4 + m plane) and K5 (Q5_K) first. Its q8 scheme (float d, integer sums) differs from llama's fp16 d/s, so expect the fp32-vs-q8 split seen here; re-run `stage_m1` (all sections) after every kernel change, comparing against this run's numbers.
2. Keep `act_q8` (or the M2 q8 kernels) behind the same validate: V1/V2 floor ratios should stay <= ~1.3.
3. Replace the host embedding dequant and per-token host sync (M3), then prefill GEMM + `gdn_seq` (M4) so V2 can compare t4q prefill vs llama batch directly.
